Risk

Program that simulates playing the board game Risk. Includes a
user selecting territories to place armies at the beginning of
the game, followed by turns in which the player can choose to
attack adjacent territories. The territories could be put into
a graph in which they are connected if one can attack another.
Various classes could hold aspects of player, territories, and
continents. The goal of the game is for one player to control 
each territory.
